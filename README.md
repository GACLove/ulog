ulog -- The universal C++ logging library
=========================================

Okay, I know that's a big name! This is a small thread-safe C++
logging library, akin to my other logging library qlog. This one is
not Qt-based though, and uses templates, so it's just a header file
you can drop somewhere in your include path and start using it.
